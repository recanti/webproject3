                For this assignment, I focused on building a workflow utilizing <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> and <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>. Sass was used mainly for creating a component-based file structure for styling, as well as for a few conveniences like variables. I used Grunt to create a compile folder. This contained a copy of the script and HTML files, as well as compiled sass code. I also used it to automatically resize images to a common width. A link to the project can be found on <a href="https://github.com/recanti/IGME-230-project2">my github</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I used Colourlovers to create <a href="http://www.colourlovers.com/palette/3674381/splash_of_color">my initial palette</a> for the site. It has been slightly modified since then. I wanted to stick to a mostly black-and-white aesthetic with a little bit of color used for emphasis. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Although I'm grateful for the organization that Sass has afforded me, I still feel like some of the blocks got a bit out-of-hand. I tended to add components when needed, and ended up breaking my plan a bit. When I go back to this, I would probably try to spruce up the files a bit and organize my components better.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also had a bit of difficulty getting images for the site. It was easy to capture a screenshot of the piece, but finding the best portion to show off in a 300x300 pixel button, was a bit daunting. I think most of them came out okay, but it's something I definitely want to try looking into in the future.

                One of the first things I did was fix the issues with the first iteration of the site. Everything validates and site position is made evident through a breadcrumbs navigation in the upper left. The header and footer use an ID tag for styling and I use and embedded Oswald font for the splash page title.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also tried to fix some of the things I wanted to fix with the last iteration of the site. I feel like my Sass files are a lot more organized and focused than they were in the last iteration of the site. It is also more mobile-friendly. Large images resize with the page and in the projects section, the buttons resize to fill the width of the screen.
            </p>
            <p>
                My Grunt workflow remained relatively the same, with the exception of a few updates to account for a new directory structure. I like the workflow a lot better now and think that the use of <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> and <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> qualifies as an above and beyond contribution to the project.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are some things that I am not quite satisfied with. I think that the splash page is a bit boring and could use an image. The same is true of the 404 page. I also think that I've reached the limit of what I can automate with the Grunt and Sass. Managing headers and footers between different directories became a hassle. I think that a Content Management System like <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> would work well for this site, but I didn't have time to implement it.
            </p>

                Once again, the theme was a modified version of <a href="http://www.colourlovers.com/palette/3674381/splash_of_color">this palette</a>. Technologies were Grunt and Sass, as well as some instances of <a href="https://jquery.com/">JQuery</a> in the about page, as well as the <a href="http://www.tectite.com/index.php">Formmail</a> php script. You can view all of the code on my <a href="https://github.com/recanti/webproject3">github</a>.
